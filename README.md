# @downwindcss/grid-center

Tailwind CSS utilities for placing items.

Instead of
1. `grid place-items-center`, do `grid-center`
1. `grid place-items-start`, do `grid-start`
1. `grid place-items-end`, do `grid-end`
1. `grid place-items-stretch`, do `grid-stretch`

This does more than "centering" items but named as `@downwindcss/grid-center`  
to match existing flex utility [@downwindcss/flex-center](https://github.com/downwindcss/flex-center).
